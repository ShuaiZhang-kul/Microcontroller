this project is called Microcontroller which contains four sub-labs:
the first lab is about writing a dataFilter based on Gaussian filter in C language
the second lab consists about two assignmentï¼š1.AD-converter 2.PWM in C language
the third lab is mainly about the communication between two PIC chips using SPI-protocal and achieving ADC-PWM function in C language
the fourth lab consists of two digital FIR-Filter:high-pass and low-pass in assembly language
